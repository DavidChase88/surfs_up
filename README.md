## The purpose of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to gather historical weather data to prove the concept for a Surf and Shake shop to a potential investor who is concerned about weather impacting the business.

## Key differences between June and December

The June summary table can be seen here:

The December summary table can be seen here:

1. June has a mean of 74.94 degrees and a median of 75.00 degrees wheras December has a mean of 71.04 degrees and median of 71.00 degrees. This suggests that there aren't many outliers pulling the mean in any direction meaning the temperature is pretty consistent.
2. The IQR range for June is 4 degrees (77 degrees to 73 degrees) wheras the IQR range for December is 5 degrees (74 degrees to 69 degrees). Again this suggests that temperatures are pretty consistent even in the winter which bodes well for the business venture.
3. The minimum temperature is 64 degrees for June which probably won't be too cold for tourists and others to surf and visit the store. However the minimum was 56 for December. This isn't that cold compared to other parts of the world's usual winter but it may be cold enough to prevent people from surfing. 


## Summary

Summer months seem to provide ideal temperature for surfing and shakes and the only concern from a temperature perspective may be winter months. However, when examining December historic data, 95% of the weather is 64 degrees to 78 degrees (2 standard deviations). If people still generally surf in 64 degree weather than this seems to be a safe assumption that temperature will not be a reason for the business to fail. I would look at precipitation for these two months and see how much rain can be expected. Additionally I would want to determine a daily rain value that we would determine as too high to negatively effect the business and do a count for what percentage of the days each month experienced these values or more. My inital reaction before that additional analysis is that this weather would not hinder business but stress that additional queries into precipitation would be necessary to ensure the investor feels confident enough that weather will not derail this business like their past business.
